Few universities offer Ruby courses & most are filled with unusable academic exercises anyway. New rubyists could instead be grown via internships. Stripe's payment platform will be demo'd as an example of the thought processes required for building useful software vs. toy apps.

Teaching & Learning Ruby in a Post-University World

Today Ruby shops lament the lack of skilled job candidates. There are lots of online resources that aspiring rubyists can access to teach themselves Ruby, however most (especially young) people don't have much life context or engineering experience to help them guage what is important to work on and what leads them down a path of weeds. 

This is where structured coursework typically comes in, but few universities have faculty with Ruby skills. During my 12 years of university education, I felt that academic exercises that would be thrown out at the end of the semester were a poor use of time compared to work that would actually be used in real world applications. Coursework did not result in knowledge of how the skills would be used in a real project and internships required learning new skills sets.

Instead of developing coursework filled with toy programming exercises, the Ruby community should grow new talent by working with aspiring Rubyists - who have demonstrated initiative - to develop real life practical business applications. The difference between academic exercises and live Ruby projects is that there is _context_ that helps students remember skills and it teaches them judgement skills to help them make decisions about what needs to be worked on and what does not.

Dr. Schaefer will use an implementation of Stripe's payment platform to show an example of the thought processes required for building useful software vs. what happens when you learn via toy applications. (Yes there will be a lot of tech in this talk about teaching.)



Very few people who know Ruby have the bureaucratic reqs for teaching at universities. People who teach at universities aren't engaged in the Ruby or entrepreneurial community. Stanford?
Aspiring rubyists come in many levels of 'beginner,' from What is Algebra to I've Made Stuff in html Before. 
People think they want to learn ruby, but they expect knowledge to appear via magic. Aspiring rubyists need self discipline, but people learn better with context and community. It also helps if they believe in what they're doing, whether they're learners or experienced.

It takes more time and thought to decide what to learn & when than to just work on something. Thus learners benefit from structure & feedback.

Entrepreneurs with 'an idea' need web developers. They also need to understand what to expect when trying to find one.


Tech req: At this time I don't foresee the need for anything beyond a projector with 15-pin VGA connection.
Over the past 20 years I've taught engineering courses at various universities, including Ruby on Rails at GMU. I'm currently experimenting with teaching Rails on Google Hangouts. I taught myself rails/ruby using online resources & the context of what I wanted to use rails for.
