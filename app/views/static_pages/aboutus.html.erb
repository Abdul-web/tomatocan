      Why we created CrowdPublish.TV 
    </div ><br>
    <div class="font19left" >
      One day I was at a meeting where Biz Stone spoke. I thought I could come up with something much better than twitter. So I decided to learn how to do web development to create something for authors that was better than the limited, predatory options that were available. <br><br>
      CrowdPublish.TV is a member of the ASU Venture Devils program.

Dr. Schaefer did engineering research at a tech think tank in the Washington, DC, suburbs where management did more tanking than thinking. <br><br>

      Dr. Schaefer took screenwriting classes from a Hollywood screenwriter and completed graduate level video production courses at American University. She has written books and produced two movies about women in technology: <%= link_to "Budget Justified", '/phases/budgetjustified' %> and <%= link_to "Lisa's 80s Catholic High School Movie", '/movie/1' %>.<br><br>
