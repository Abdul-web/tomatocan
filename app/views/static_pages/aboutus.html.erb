      What is CrowdPublish.TV 
    </div ><br>
    <div class="font19left" >
      A place for authors, videographers, and other storytellers to market-test their stories while earning financial support from fans to create stories about Respectable Characters; a place to find and offer support for stories about characters we'd like to see more of in society. Fiction, nonfiction, books, articles, short stories, documentaries, movies, short video clips, video games - all types of storytelling are welcome as long as they show characters who make the world a better place. <br><br>

      Fans benefit by receiving items beyond just books and movies - storytellers offer the opportunity for fans to engage with storytellers via social media or other methods, sneak preview access, and any other unique items that only the storytellers can offer. CrowdPublish.TV helps storytellers come up with a list of suggested <%= link_to "Perks to offer fans", "/suggestedperks" %>.

      Why we created CrowdPublish.TV 
    </div ><br>
    <div class="font19left" >
      After CSI grew popular, students signed up in droves to become forensic scientists. Lisa Schaefer noticed the impact popular culture had on what people think is possible for their own lives and lamented the lack of stories about women in tech and leadership positions.<br><br>

      Upon completion of her Ph.D. in engineering, Dr. Schaefer moved to Washington, DC, where management created videos about research they didn't do, in efforts to fool the federal government into giving them more taxpayer money. As she produced her own stories about what was really going on in government offices (featuring a woman in tech), she realized other storytellers needed a platform where they were not beholden to the limited, predatory business options that were available and where they had the potential to free themselves from dysfunctional employment situations.<br><br> 

      After a colleague mentioned that the way to differentiate CrowdPublish.TV from other crowdfunding sites is not the different features we offer, but the culture, we realized we had to embrace the reason Dr. Schaefer produced her own stories in the first place. We needed to encourage stories about role models, the antithesis to the bombardment of media glorifying vapid people who were famous for being famous and to discourage trolly porn that often appears on other self-publishing platforms from appearing on the site. <br><br>

      Dr. Schaefer intends that CrowdPublish.TV will become a platform where fascinating livestreaming discussions with storytellers can be found 24 hours a day. Where storytellers can grow a business selling and spreading ideas along with tangible goods to their loyal fanbase, without dependence on an employer who may not embrace their message.
