<%= link_to "HOW TO GET INVOLVED", "/getinvolved" %>.<br><br>

The Local Authors Scene is an informal grassroots movement of authors who own the rights to their work & local intellectuals who are interested in hearing what authors have to say -- the story behind the story. Every month we host a local author, along with a discussion of how local authors produce their books and discover fans. The general public is always encouraged to come listen to our authors & get involved in the following discussion. <br><br>
