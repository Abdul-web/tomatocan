Let me know if you have questions! Lisa@CrowdPublish.TV <br><br> 

Our Nov/Dec gathering will be a holiday party, December 13, 5:30-8:30pm at the Community Room Fairfax Station Railroad Museum, 11200 Fairfax Station Road, PO Box 7, Fairfax Station, VA 22039. Due to the expense of renting a facility that allows wine (the free Fairfax Co. library facilities do not allow alcohol), the event is open only to paid NoVAWC members. It will be a pot-luck and members of the NoVA Writers Club will give 5 minute readings from their work. - See <%= link_to 'Calendar', calendar_path %>. 

The Local Authors Scene gatherings are organized by the Northern Virginia Writers Club. NoVAWC VP, Bill Frost will be moving out of the DC area next year, thus we’re looking for people who may be interested in running for a NoVAWC office next year. Contact Lisa@CrowdPublish.TV if you’re interested in running for VP, or if you’d like to volunteer for a committee chair role.
