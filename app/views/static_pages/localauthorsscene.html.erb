(Our Nov/Dec gathering will be a holiday party, most likely the first or second week of December at the Nature Center in Reston, same place as last year. It will be a pot-luck and members of the NoVA Writers Club will give 5 minute readings from their work. We’ll have a sign-up sheet for the pot-luck and for readings once we have the location and date confirmed. - See <%= link_to 'Calendar', calendar_path %>. )

NoVAWC VP, Bill Frost will be moving out of the DC area next year, thus we’re looking for people who may be interested in running for a NoVAWC office next year. Contact Lisa@CrowdPublish.TV if you’re interested in running for VP, or if you’d like to volunteer for a committee chair role.
