      If the setup is the same as last year, we'll be at the big round tables in the huge hall where all the authors & books are. We'll stake out a few tables so you can grab a lunch at one of the many food vendors & come sit with us. Come & go as you please, we'll be there for two hours.<br><br>

      There will be a large seating area with several large round tables in the huge hall where the books & authors are located. Look for tables with Local Authors Scene cards bearing the CrowdPublishTV logo.
