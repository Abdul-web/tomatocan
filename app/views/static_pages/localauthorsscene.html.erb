Are you interested in keeping up with what local writers are up to? Do you believe in supporting authors who own their rights? Sign up for CrowdPublish.TV & hang out with DC-area booklovers and local authors. 
<%= link_to "HOW TO GET INVOLVED", "/getinvolved" %>.<br><br>

The Local Authors Scene is an informal grassroots movement of authors who own the rights to their work & local intellectuals who are interested in hearing what authors have to say -- the story behind the story. The general public is always encouraged to come listen to our authors & get involved in the discussion. <br><br>

Sign up for a FREE web site on http://CrowdPublish.TV, an open source project developed by DC area software engineers. Authors can list their books, blog, videos, & events. Readers & book clubs can review books & post their blog and events. And most of all, <%= link_to "Get Involved!", "/getinvolved" %><br><br>
