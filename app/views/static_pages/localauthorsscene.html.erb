          for the Local Authors Scene!

    <% end %>

The goal of the Local Authors Scene is to collaborate with DC area writer groups and book clubs to promote more buzz about local authors' work and help authors who own their rights navigate the changing world of publishing. Every month we feature an author who speaks about their book, followed by a discussion of how local authors create & publicize their books. The general public is always encouraged to come listen to our authors & stay for the following discussion. List your books, blog, & events and browse the calendar of local book events on CrowdPublish.TV! <br><br>
