  Imagine walking people through your story -<wbr>Â literally. Carry your phone through a forest and give a talk about your story about a knight's journey as you walk among the trees. Or take your readers through the streets of Philadelphia, where your story of the history of our nation unfolds. Or perhaps you're a software developer and your book tells us how to become savvy app developers ourselves. You can walk us through the process step by step while potential readers are having coffee with friends or waiting in an airport.<br><br>
As cyberspace progresses, our experiences online are becoming more and more interactive. CrowdPublish.TV facilitates the interaction by helping readers and authors communicate with each other in a media-<wbr>rich environment.<br><br>
