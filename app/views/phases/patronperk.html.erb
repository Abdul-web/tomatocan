All items offered for sale through CrowdPublish.TV are meant to be immediately available and fulfilled within a week. No need for your Patrons to wait until project or phase is complete before they receive their items. So if you're offering to tweet to them, do it as soon as you see their contribution posted on your dashboard. If you're offering an hour of consulting time, text or call to arrange a session right away! Check your dashboard often.<br><br>
